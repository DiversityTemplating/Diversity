Diversity
=========

Diversity components, by [Textalk](http://www.textalk.com/).

Here will be the Diversity specifications and website.  The project is in it's initiation phase;
don't expect things to be in working or stable order just yet.  Come back in a few weeks.


Diversity components are reusable search engine optimized (SEO) web components, specified by
mustache templates, supporting dependencies, backend fetching of data over JSON-RPC, supporting
AngularJS templating on the frontend (by doing collected manual bootstrapping).

This component system is constructed for use with [Textalk Webshop](http://www.textalk.com/webshop),
but is in no way limited to that use.
