Diversity
=========

Diversity components, by [Textalk](http://www.textalk.com/).

Here will be the Diversity specifications and website.  The project is in it's initiation phase;
don't expect things to be in working or stable order just yet.  Come back in a few weeks.

Diversity components are reusable search engine optimized (SEO) web components, specified by
mustache templates, supporting dependencies, backend fetching of data over JSON-RPC, localization,
and AngularJS templating on the frontend (by doing collected manual bootstrapping).

The components are supposed to be able to render in a lot of different circumstances.  There are
Diversity Engines in progress in Ruby, PHP and frontend JavaScript.  The specification is designed
to make implementation easy in any programming language.

This component system is constructed for use with [Textalk Webshop](http://www.textalk.com/webshop),
but is in no way limited to that use.
